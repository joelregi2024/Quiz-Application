üìã About This Project
This project is a self-contained, multiple-choice quiz application. It's written entirely in a single Java file (ModernQuizApp.java) and uses the Java Swing library for its graphical user interface.

It serves as a great example for learning:

Java GUI development with Swing.

Handling user events (like button clicks).

Basic state management (tracking score and current question).

Using the "Nimbus" Look and Feel for a more modern UI.

‚ú® Features

Multiple-Choice Questions: Presents questions with four radio-button options.

Score Tracking: Automatically calculates and tracks the user's score.

Instant Feedback: Checks the answer and moves to the next question.

Final Score Summary: Displays a final "Quiz Finished!" dialog with the total score.

Single-File Program: The entire application is contained in one .java file, making it easy to run and understand.
